Pfizer Sales Territory Optimization

This project focuses on designing optimized sales territories for Pfizer using clustering and data-driven analysis. The goal is to create balanced, geographically coherent regions that distribute workload fairly across sales representatives.

The work was done in Python through a Jupyter Notebook.

⸻

🔍 What the Project Does
	•	Cleans and explores Pfizer’s sales + geographic data
	•	Engineers features to quantify workload and location
	•	Uses K-Means clustering to design new sales territories
	•	Evaluates whether the optimized territories are more balanced and efficient
	•	Visualizes clusters and geographic distributions for decision-making

⸻

🧠 Methods & Tools
	•	Python, Jupyter Notebook
	•	Pandas, NumPy
	•	Scikit-learn (clustering)
	•	Matplotlib / Seaborn

⸻

📈 Key Outcomes
	•	More evenly balanced sales territories
	•	Better geographic cohesion
	•	Reduced overlap between regions
	•	Clear visualizations comparing original vs. optimized territories
